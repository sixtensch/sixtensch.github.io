I’m an upbeat, motivated, analytical, and result-oriented student at the *Blekinge Institute of Technology* in Karlskrona. I prioritize organization, organic teamwork, and high-quality output in my work, and I’m very passionate about learning and self-improvement. While I'm sometimes obsessive in my approach, I’ve always been described as intelligent, supportive, industrious, persistent, and a fantastic problem solver.

Outside of work, I dedicate much of my time to learning and honing various skills, along with a great interest in various geeky hobbies—tabletop RPGs, card games, and small game development projects with friends.

In all aspects of life, I find the flames of enthusiasm, dedication, and ambition to be my personal core. These traits have driven me to continuously learn and improve, which has always been an integral part of who I am. As a teenager, I found working at a local family restaurant incredibly rewarding, and even though the pay itself wasn't impressive, I found the challenge and the experience totally worth it.

I grew up just outside Malmö in southern Sweden, from where I’ve since moved to Karlskrona in pursuit of my dream of becoming a proficient game engine developer. In my home we’ve always valued respect, individuality, and cooperation highly, and as a coworker I always strive to be both productive and helpful. I firmly believe that effective cooperation is more important than sheer individual ability, and that finding common ground, fostering synergy, and maintaining strong team morale are essential to success.

Studying video game programming and technology in high school, I graduated at the top of my class and was awarded a scholarship for academic excellence. I’ve always been quite a diligent worker, quick to pick up new skills, and adaptable to different environments. Once, I was an adamant perfectionist, and while that trait is easy to glorify, I'm happy to have worked my way up to something better: battle-hardened, but grounded.
